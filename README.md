# stock-ticker

This is a short VBA program I wrote last year that loops through the ticker symbols on a sheet of stocks.  It then outputs the yearly and percent change from the beginning to closing of the year, as well as the total stock volume.  The script will also loop through multiple years (worksheets) and returns which stocks performed the best and worst that year.
